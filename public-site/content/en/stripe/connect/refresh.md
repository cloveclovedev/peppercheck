## Please restart the onboarding flow

It looks like the Stripe Connect onboarding flow did not finish.  
Go back to the Peppercheck app, open the Profile screen, and tap “Setup Stripe Connect account” again to resume.

- If you closed the browser or spent too long on the Stripe form, restarting the flow will resume from where you left off.
- Information you already entered is saved with Stripe, so you only need to provide missing details.
