## Stripe Connect setup completed

You have successfully finished the Stripe Connect onboarding flow.
Return to the Peppercheck app and refresh the Profile screen to see the latest account status.

- If the app does not reflect the new state, please restart the app and try again.
- Stripe may ask for additional information later; in that case you will be redirected to the onboarding flow again.

If you have any questions, contact us at `hi@peppercheck.app`.
