# Notification Template Keys

## Naming Convention

Pattern: `notification_{event}_{recipient}` where `{recipient}` is `_tasker` or `_referee`.

Every key must have a recipient suffix. The `notification_` prefix is retained as a namespace.

## Full details

See `docs/overview/naming-conventions.md` for the complete specification including the system flow and how to add new notifications.
