= Documentation Architecture

This document defines the structure, naming conventions, and templates for the `developer-docs`.

== Directory Structure

The documentation content is primarily located in `pages/`. Source codes for diagrams (e.g., PlantUML) and other included resources are placed in `examples/`.

== Templates & Guidelines

=== Overview Guidelines

`pages/overview/` contains product-level context. There is no rigid template, but documents should generally cover:

* *Background/Purpose*: Why this product exists.
* *Requirements/Scope*: Detailed requirements and out-of-scope items.
* *Pricing*: Price structure and plans.
* *Domain/Concept*: High-level domain model if needed.

=== Feature Page Template

`pages/features/` describes a user-facing feature (e.g., Task, Payment) that spans multiple technologies.

* *Title*: [Feature Name]
* *User Story*: "As a [Role], I want to [Action], so that [Benefit]." (The "Why" & "Goal")
* *Architecture/Flow*: Sequence Diagrams / State Diagrams (The "System Behavior").
* *Technical Components*: Brief list of involved components (Flutter, Supabase, Stripe, etc.).
* *Data Model*: Table Schema / ER Diagram (Physical tables involved).
* *Configuration*: Env vars, settings.
* *Related Links*: Links to specific tech stack docs (e.g., `xref:stripe/scripts/sync-prices.adoc[sync-prices]`, `xref:flutter/features/billing.adoc[Billing]`).

=== Tech Stack Template

`pages/[tech-stack]/` details implementation specifics for a technology (e.g., a specific script or function).

* *Title*: [Component/Script Name]
* *Purpose*: What does this specific script/function do?
* *Usage*: Command or trigger.
* *Inputs/Outputs*: Parameters, return values.
* *Dependencies*: What does it rely on?
