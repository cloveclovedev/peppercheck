= Issue & Milestone Management
:sectnums:

This document defines how GitHub Issues and Milestones are used to plan and track work in this project.

== Core Principles

* **Flat issues only** — No Epic hierarchy. Every issue is a directly actionable work unit.
* **Milestones carry due dates** — Issues do not have individual due dates. Milestones define "what ships when."
* **Milestone = scheduled, No milestone = backlog** — If an issue has a milestone, it is committed to a time frame. If not, it is in the backlog with no scheduled delivery.
* **Define milestones just-in-time** — Only the next 1–2 milestones should be concretely defined. Do not create milestones for the distant future.

== Milestones

=== Naming

Milestones use semantic versioning: `v0.3.0`, `v1.0.0`, etc. Each milestone corresponds to a release or a meaningful deliverable.

=== Lifecycle

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| State | Meaning

| Open (with due date)
| Active or upcoming. Issues are being worked on or planned.

| Closed
| All issues completed and the release is shipped.
|===

* When all issues in a milestone are done, close the milestone.
* Update due dates when schedules change rather than leaving stale dates.
* Delete milestones that are no longer relevant (e.g., plans changed significantly).

=== Scope

A milestone groups all work for a release: features, bug fixes, refactoring, and chores. There is no separate "tech debt" or "maintenance" milestone — those issues belong to whichever release they ship with.

== Issues

=== Granularity

One issue = one actionable piece of work. This can range from a small bug fix to a large feature, as long as it is a coherent unit.

For large features, use a single issue with a checklist in the body to track sub-tasks:

[source,markdown]
----
## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Database schema changes
- [ ] Backend API
- [ ] Flutter UI
- [ ] Tests
----

Split into multiple issues only when sub-tasks need independent tracking (e.g., assigned to different people or different milestones).

=== Labels

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Label | Usage

| `type/feature`
| A user-facing feature or significant capability.

| `type/task`
| Internal task: refactoring, infrastructure, tooling.

| `bug`
| Something is broken.

| `enhancement`
| Improvement to an existing feature.

| `area/*`
| Technology area: `area/supabase`, `area/android`, `area/web`, `area/infra`, `area/cloudflare`.

| `priority/P0`–`P3`
| Urgency level (P0 = critical, P3 = low).
|===

=== Backlog

Issues without a milestone are backlog items. They represent work that is valid but has no scheduled delivery. When planning the next milestone, pull relevant backlog issues in and assign the milestone.

== Workflow

=== Planning a milestone

1. Review backlog issues and recent feedback.
2. Create a milestone with a version number and realistic due date.
3. Assign issues to the milestone.
4. Begin work, updating issue status as you go.

=== During development

* Close issues as they are completed (via PR or direct close).
* If scope changes, move issues between milestones or back to backlog.
* If the due date slips, update it — do not leave stale dates.

=== Completing a milestone

1. Verify all assigned issues are closed.
2. Close the milestone.
3. Create the next milestone if not already defined.
