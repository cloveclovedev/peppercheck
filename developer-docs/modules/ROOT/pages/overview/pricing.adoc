== Overview
Peppercheck uses a subscription + point system.
Taskers receive monthly points based on their subscription plan and consume points when requesting reviews.
Referees receive monetary rewards for each completed review.

This document describes the pricing rules, subscription behavior, and point usage.

== Tasker Subscription Plans

=== Web (Stripe Billing)
Stripe is the primary subscription platform.

=== Point Consumption
* Standard review request: **1pt**
* Premium match request (high-rated Referee): **2pt**

=== Point Reset Policy
* Unused points **do not carry over**.
* Points are **reset at each new billing cycle**.
* This ensures stable cost control and predictable system load.

== Referee Rewards

Referees earn a fixed reward per completed review.

| Standard Review (1pt)
| 50円

| Premium Review (2pt)

=== Payout Timing
* Rewards are aggregated monthly.
* Payments are made at the end of each month via the payment provider (Stripe Connect or equivalent).
* This model does not fall under money transfer regulations; Peppercheck pays Referees as contractors.

== Platforms and Purchasing Rules

=== Web (Recommended)
* Users can subscribe or update plans via Stripe Billing.
* Web prices are the lowest due to lower fees.

=== Mobile Apps (iOS / Android)
* Subscriptions may be purchased via IAP.
* App prices are higher to absorb store platform fees.
* App UI may include “Manage subscription on the Web” where allowed by platform guidelines.

== Subscription State Endpoint
Both the mobile app and Web use a unified subscription status interface.

Implementation options:

* Supabase RPC (`get_subscription_status`)
* Supabase Edge Function (`/subscription-status`)

Returned fields include:

* plan
* status
* current_period_start / end
* points balance
* next point grant date
* provider (stripe / google / apple)

== Summary
Peppercheck’s billing system is based on:

* Fixed monthly subscriptions via Stripe or IAP
* Monthly point grants
* Point consumption for each task request
* Simple and predictable Referee rewards
* Unified subscription status management

This structure ensures consistency across Web, Android, and future iOS platforms.
