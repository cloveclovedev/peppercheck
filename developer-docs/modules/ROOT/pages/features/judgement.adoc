= Judgement
:sectnums:

This document describes the Judgement feature, where Referees approve or reject evidence submitted by Taskers.

== Prerequisites

* xref:features/task.adoc[Task Lifecycle] — Judgements exist within the Task → Request → Judgement hierarchy.
* xref:features/evidence.adoc[Evidence Submission] — Evidence must be submitted before a Referee can judge.

== Overview

After a Tasker submits evidence, the assigned Referee reviews it and either approves or rejects it with a comment, so that the Tasker receives feedback on their task completion.
The judgement is performed via the `judge_evidence` RPC, which validates the caller, checks the current status, and updates the judgement record.

== Judgement Flow

The following sequence diagram illustrates the full judgement flow, including evidence submission notification, the judge action, and the optional rejection-resubmission cycle.

== State Transitions

Judgement status values (PostgreSQL enum `judgement_status`):

|===
|Status |Description |Transitions To

|`awaiting_evidence`
|Initial state. Waiting for Tasker to submit.
|`in_review`, `evidence_timeout`

|`in_review`
|Evidence submitted. Referee is reviewing.
|`approved`, `rejected`, `review_timeout`

|`approved`
|Referee approved. Tasker can confirm & rate.
|Confirmed (via `is_confirmed = true`)

|`rejected`
|Referee rejected. Tasker may resubmit (once, before due date).
|`in_review` (resubmission), Confirmed

|`review_timeout`
|Referee failed to judge in time.
|Confirmed

|`evidence_timeout`
|Tasker failed to submit evidence in time.
|Confirmed

NOTE: For the full state diagram including Task and Request lifecycles, see xref:features/task.adoc[Task Lifecycle].

== Technical Components

=== RPC: `judge_evidence`
* **Parameters**: `p_judgement_id` (uuid), `p_status` (judgement_status: `approved` or `rejected`), `p_comment` (text)
* **Validation**:
** Caller must be the matched referee for this judgement.
** Current judgement status must be `in_review`.
** Comment must be non-empty.
** Status must be `approved` or `rejected`.

=== Flutter: `JudgementSection` widget
* Displays an inline form for referees when status is `in_review`.
* Shows read-only result cards (avatar, status, comment) for completed judgements.
* Displays a confirmation form for the tasker when status is `approved` or `rejected` and `is_confirmed = false`:
** Binary rating buttons (positive / negative) for the Referee.
** Optional comment field.
* Uses `JudgementController` (AsyncNotifier) and `JudgementRepository`.

=== Triggers: Notifications
* `on_task_evidences_upserted_notify_referee` — Notifies the referee when evidence is submitted or updated.
* `on_judgements_status_changed` — Notifies the tasker when judgement is approved or rejected.

Both triggers use the `notify_event()` function, which calls the `send-notification` Edge Function.

== Confirm Judgement

After a Referee approves or rejects, the Tasker confirms the judgement via `confirm_judgement_and_rate_referee` RPC.
This atomically settles points, grants the Referee a reward, and records a binary rating (`is_positive`).
See xref:features/payment-and-reward.adoc[Payment & Reward Flow] for settlement details.

== Confirm Evidence Timeout

When evidence times out, settlement happens automatically via the `settle_evidence_timeout` trigger (see xref:features/evidence.adoc[Evidence Submission]).
The Tasker then calls `confirm_evidence_timeout` RPC to set `is_confirmed = true`, which may trigger task closure.

== Data Model

=== `judgements` table

|===
|Column |Type |Description

|`id`
|uuid (PK, FK → task_referee_requests)
|Shares ID with its parent request

|`status`
|judgement_status (enum)
|Current judgement state

|`comment`
|text
|Referee's comment (required on approve/reject)

|`is_confirmed`
|boolean
|Whether the judgement has been finalized

|`reopen_count`
|smallint
|Number of times evidence was resubmitted (max 1)
