= Payment & Reward Flow
:sectnums:

This document describes how subscriptions, points, and referee rewards are handled in Peppercheck, focusing on Stripe Connect integration and operational best practices in Japan.

== Overview

* **Tasker** purchases subscriptions and points from Peppercheck.
* **Tasker** consumes points to request reviews.
* **Referee** completes reviews and earns rewards.
* **Peppercheck** handles payments as a marketplace platform using Stripe Connect.

[NOTE]
.Perspective difference
====
**UX perspective**: It appears as if Taskers pay Referees directly. +
**Legal/Technical perspective**: Peppercheck collects payments first and pays Referees as contractors.

|Role |Description

|Tasker
|Purchases subscriptions and points, requests reviews

|Referee
|Completes reviews and earns rewards

|Peppercheck
|Marketplace platform and payment operator
|===

== Key Design Principles

* Subscriptions and points break direct Tasker → Referee payment relationships.
* Peppercheck acts as the payment intermediary (marketplace model).
* Referee rewards are treated as **contractor payments**.
* UX and wording emphasize "Tasker paying Referee", while the backend remains compliant.

== Stripe Connect Strategy

* **Account Type**: Stripe Connect (Express or Custom accounts)
* **Charge Model**: Separate Charges & Transfers
* **Payouts**: Referee payouts handled via Stripe balances

== Reward Timing Design

=== Reward Transfer Timing (Peppercheck → Referee Stripe balance)

==== Chosen approach: Review-based (per completed review)

* When a review is completed:
** Reward is finalized in Peppercheck DB
** Funds are immediately transferred to the Referee’s Stripe balance
** This does **not** trigger a bank payout yet

==== Reasons

* Immediate visibility of earnings for Referees
* Small, isolated transactions reduce failure impact
* Aligns with standard marketplace / gig-economy patterns
* Simplifies monthly settlement logic

=== Payout Timing (Referee Stripe balance → Bank account)

==== Chosen approach: Monthly automatic payout

* Stripe handles payouts automatically on a monthly schedule
* No payout API call required per review
* Minimum payout thresholds can be applied (e.g. ¥1,000)

== Fees

* **Transfer (Peppercheck → Referee Stripe balance)**: No fee
* **Standard payout (Stripe → Japanese bank account)**: No fee
* **Fees apply only to**:
** Card payments
** Platform fees
** Instant payouts (generally unavailable in Japan)

== Platform Balance Management

* Transfers require sufficient Peppercheck Stripe balance
* Peppercheck must maintain a safety buffer
* Recommended safeguards:
** Balance threshold checks before transfers
** Temporary `pending` state if balance is insufficient
** Admin alerts for low balance

== Operational Flow

The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of purchases, point consumption, review rewards, and final payouts.

== UX vs Legal Separation

* **UI and copy**:
** "Your points are paid to the Referee"
** "You earned ¥X from this Tasker’s request"
* **Backend reality**:
** Peppercheck pays Referees as contractors
** Stripe Connect manages compliance and payouts

== What This Design Optimizes For

* Clean Stripe Connect integration
* Predictable payouts for Referees
* Low operational overhead
* Scalability
* Compliance with Japanese payment constraints

== Out of Scope (Handled Separately)

* Tax handling and withholding
* Invoice system considerations
* Annual payment reports
