= Supabase Local Setup

== Environment Variables & Secrets

=== Google Service Account (for IAP Verification)

To enable Google Play In-App Purchase verification, you must set the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret for the Edge Functions.

1.  Obtain a Service Account Key (JSON) from Google Cloud Console with **Android Publisher** permissions.
2.  Set the secret locally (or in your project dashboard):

[source,bash]
----
# For local development (if using valid .env linked to secrets) or production
supabase secrets set GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "...",
  ...
}'
----

_Note: For purely local testing via `supabase start`, secrets are often managed via `.env` file in `supabase/functions/.env` if not using the vault._
